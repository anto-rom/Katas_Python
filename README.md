Logic Project: Python Katas
This repository contains a series of programming exercises (katas) in Python designed to strengthen computational logic skills, the use of higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce), error handling, classes, conditional structures, and functional programming.

📌 Objectives
Improve programming logic.

Apply lambda functions and functional structures in Python.

Practice error handling and validations.

Implement custom classes and methods.

Get familiar with conditional structures and loops.

📂 Project Structure
Each kata is implemented as an independent function or class. The project is divided into thematic blocks covering different aspects of the language:

🔡 Text and List Manipulation
Letter frequency in a string.

Counting, replacing, and deleting words.

Word lengths and converting tuples into strings.

🔢 Numeric Operations
Doubling numbers using map().

List differences and averages.

Recursive factorials.

Converting lists of digits into integers using reduce().

🐾 Filters and Validations
Filtering lists based on criteria (e.g., banned pets, odd numbers, integers).

Custom exceptions in division and age validation.

🧮 Lambda and Functional Functions
Sums, filters, cubes, total products and differences using lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming
Tree class: structure and manipulation of branches and trunk.

BankUser class: simulating banking operations between users.

🧠 Conditional Logic and Interactive Programs
Grade calculation in text format.

Determining time of day based on the hour.

Discount system for purchases using if/else structures.

▶️ How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/youruser/proyecto-katas-python.git
cd proyecto-katas-python
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

No external libraries required (only functools)
